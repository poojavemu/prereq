		<div id="mission">We are trying to solve the problem of teens and young adults engaging in unprotected sex. To solve this issue we created this website that will show a map with locations and clinics that offer free condoms, HIV testing, pregnancy testing, and clinics that do not require parent involvement for those who are underage. Our target audience consists of sexually active teenagers and young adults.</div>
